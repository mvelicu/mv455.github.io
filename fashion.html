         <p align="center" style="font-size:60px">Like mentioned before, the looks of the 90s are all about looking grunge and fun styling. Good 90s fashion means a bit of schoolgirl look – think mini skirts, knee-high socks and platform shoes –, a smidgen of R&B look – those with high-waisted jeans, dungarees, and oversized jacket – and a whole lot of Britpop grungy chic – from slip dresses, Doc Martens, and cardigans, to plaid shirt, layering, and low-rise, ripped, wide-leg jeans. While the Grunge style itself screams for an overall “sloppy” look that suggests you to not spend very much time putting together your outfit, and yet still managed to look awesome anyway. For a little hint of this cool fashion trend, take a look at some of the best ‘90s fashion channeled by style icons of the 90s – whether they wore them on the movie or real life.</p>
